# Caltech101 Classification with ResNet, VGG using Pytorch

This project aims to classify Caltech101 dataset, which comprises of approximately 9000 images in 101 classes. 
Pytorch is used as the framework. You can find the dataset [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/).

## Getting Started 

For using the dataset class (dataset.py) module without any revision, I recommend you to downlaod the data from the above link given. 
Please be sure to delete the */BACKGROUND_Google* folder as it contatins random background images irrelevant of the 101 classes.

### Prerequistites

To install the version of the PyTorch the script was ran on please enter the following command.
'''
conda install pytorch=1.0.1
'''
